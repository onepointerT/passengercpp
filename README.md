# passengercpp
### A library that is havening a passenger arriving and departing node graph with and without actions on edges
#### v0.1.0

This small library is implemented to handle concurrent consent arbitrary passengers of nodes and solves the following questions to source code and graph marker member departure behaviour:

* Which members need to be arrived to start at this node
* Which members are accepted at the node
* Which members are already arrived at the node
* How many members can arrive at a node
* Does an edge have an action to implement, and if any, it will be absolved
